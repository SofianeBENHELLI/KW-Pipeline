"""Response schema for ``GET /documents/{document_id}/confidence`` —
the reviewer-UI confidence dashboard (converged plan §C.1).

Wraps the existing :class:`~app.schemas.validation_metadata.ConfidenceScore`
with the version context the dashboard needs to render: which version
is being scored, whether the score actually exists (versions that
predate the scorer or where ``KW_HITL_DISABLE_SCORER`` is set carry no
``ConfidenceScore``), the threshold the operator's deployment is
tuned to, and the lifecycle outcomes (routing decision + how it was
actually validated).

The dashboard does not own scoring — it's a strict read view over
:class:`ValidationMetadata` rows the scorer already produces on the
NEEDS_REVIEW transition (ADR-023). The route is the operator-facing
surface; the data has been there since EPIC-A slice 1.

    """Composite confidence view for one document's reported version.

    The route reports on the document's ``latest_version_id`` by
    default. Operators inspecting historical drift can target a
    specific version via the ``?version_id=`` query param; the
    response carries the resolved id so the frontend can confirm
    which version it's rendering.

    ``has_score`` is ``False`` when the resolved version exists but
    no :class:`~app.schemas.validation_metadata.ConfidenceScore` was
    persisted — either the scorer was disabled
    (``KW_HITL_DISABLE_SCORER`` truthy), the version never reached
    NEEDS_REVIEW under the scorer's wiring, or the version predates
    the scorer (legacy data). In all three cases the rest of the
    fields below are ``None`` and the frontend should render a "no
    confidence data" empty state rather than zeros.

    ``auto_validate_threshold`` is included so the dashboard can
    render the pass / fail visual against the operator's configured
    cut-off (``KW_HITL_AUTO_VALIDATE_THRESHOLD``, default 0.85)
    without a second config round-trip. It's the threshold the HITL
    router uses for the ``auto`` routing decision; the score being
    above it does NOT mean the version was actually auto-validated
    (that's :attr:`validation_method`).
